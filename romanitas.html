    <h1><em>Romanitas</em></h1>
    <h2>What does it mean to be Roman?</h2>
    <p>
      The Romans used the word <em>romanitas</em> to talk about what they thought it meant to be a 'real' Roman. Just as in the United States today, the definition of an 'American' is subject to interpretation, differs according to context, and is vaguely described with colloquialisms (<em>'as American as apple pie'</em> is one such example), there were multiple competing ideologies of 'Roman-ness' or <em>romanitas</em>.

      <h2>The elements of <em>romanitas</em></h2>

        <section>
          <h4>gender</h4>
          <h5>Generally speaking, the Romans acknowledged two genders which they considered to be immutable and proscriptive. Questions they had around gender were: male or female? something else? living as the gender assigned at birth? living up to one's gender role?</h5>
        </section>
          <h4>sexuality/sexual behavior</h4>
          <h5>People in ancient Rome were mostly concerned with <em>sexual behavior</em>: is this person involved with others to whom sexual access is legal and socially permissable? are they married? monogamous? in control of their sexual appetites? do they have sexual autonomy? do they have power over others, sexually? are they 'passive' or 'active'?</h5>
        <section>
          <h4>social status</h4>
          <h5>Slave or free? Born free? A citizen? Circumstances of enslavement? Parents' social status? Today we think of social status and economic status as being tied. That was not the case in the ancient world, in which slavery was common and often impermanent.</h5>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>economic status</h4>
          <h5>Economic status was definied in the following terms: Is a person rich or poor? Are they financially dependent or independent? If rich, how did one make their money? Do they work for a living? Are they a skilled artisan? Are they able to move up in society? Do they own slaves, and if so, how many and what kind?</h5>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>ethnicity/place of origin</h4>
          <h5>The first question of ethnicity is whether someone is geographically Roman by birth. After the first century BCE, geographical Romanness seems to have expanded to include persons born to Roman parents in the provinces (such as the children of soldiers or governors) as well as anyone born in Italy. Still, the status of one's ancestors mattered - in other words, being a third generation Roman was less impressive than being able to trace your family back centuries.</h5>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>religion</h4>
          <h5>Before Rome was Christianized, Romanitas was a religious identity, and the empire had many religions. Questions about religious identity were: is this person a follower of 'mainstream' (i.e., state-sanctioned) religious practices? Does this person identify as a Jew or a Christian, or belong to a mystery cult or some other foreign religion? Does this person practice magic? How long have their gods been popular?</h5>
