    <h4>What does it mean to be Roman?</h4>
    <p>
      The Romans used the word <em>romanitas</em> to talk about what they thought it meant to be a 'real' Roman. Just as in the United States today, the definition of an 'American' is subject to interpretation, differs according to context, and is vaguely described with colloquialisms (<em>'as American as apple pie'</em> is one such example), there were multiple competing ideologies of 'Roman-ness' or <em>romanitas</em>.
